---

### **Phase 1: Planning & Structure**

- **Goal**: Define the overall architecture and plan the flow for the CLI tool.
- **Tasks**:
  1. Define user flows (questions to ask, options, and settings).
  2. Organize folder and file structure for the CLI tool.
  3. Define core modules (e.g., install, update, project generation).
  4. Define external dependencies (libraries, frameworks).
  5. Plan versioning strategy and GitHub setup (releases).

### **Phase 2: Core Features Development**

#### **2.1. CLI Setup and Basics**
   - **Goal**: Create the basic structure of the CLI tool using `urfave/cli`.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Set up the CLI framework.
     2. Implement the global installation mechanism (via Go install, Homebrew, etc.).
     3. Implement basic commands:
        - `install`
        - `generate`
        - `update`
        - `help`

#### **2.2. User Input & Configuration Flow**
   - **Goal**: Design and implement the question and answer flow for setting up a project.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Implement questions for project type selection (API/Web/Both).
     2. Implement question flow for the user to choose preferred Go framework (Gin, Echo, Fiber).
     3. Implement options for logging system (Zap/Logrus).
     4. Add database configuration options (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).
     5. Implement cache and queue system options.
     6. Set up user choices for authentication system, email service, and session management.
     7. Integrate auto-settings (Go max procs, graceful shutdown, rate-limiting, CORS).

#### **2.3. Project Scaffolding**
   - **Goal**: Based on user choices, generate a scaffolded project structure.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Define templates for the project structure.
     2. Automatically generate project files based on user inputs.
     3. Implement automatic dependency injection setup (Wire).
     4. Ensure DI setup and other configurations (logging, CORS, etc.) are correctly added.

### **Phase 3: Installation, Update, and Notifications**

#### **3.1. Installation Process**
   - **Goal**: Make it easy for users to install the CLI tool globally.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Implement Go installation method (`go install github.com/droqsic/cli`).
     2. Set up precompiled binary distributions (GitHub Releases for Linux, macOS, Windows).
     3. Set up Homebrew and Chocolatey taps (optional).

#### **3.2. Update Mechanism**
   - **Goal**: Allow users to easily update to the latest version.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Implement version checking on every run.
     2. Display a notification when a new version is available.
     3. Implement `update` command to handle manual updates.

#### **3.3. Versioning Strategy**
   - **Goal**: Define a versioning system for the CLI tool.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Implement semantic versioning (major, minor, patch).
     2. Ensure clear versioning through Git tags and GitHub Releases.
     3. Add a changelog and release notes for each version.

---

### **Phase 4: Testing & Documentation**

#### **4.1. Testing**
   - **Goal**: Ensure the tool works as expected in various environments and setups.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Write unit tests for core functions (e.g., user input handling, project generation).
     2. Test across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
     3. Test with various configurations (database, cache, etc.).
     4. Automate testing using GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools.

#### **4.2. Documentation**
   - **Goal**: Provide clear instructions on how to use the CLI tool.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Write usage documentation for all CLI commands.
     2. Create installation guides for various platforms (Go, Homebrew, Chocolatey).
     3. Write a comprehensive user guide for the setup process.
     4. Document advanced configurations and options.

### **Phase 5: Release & Deployment**

#### **5.1. Final Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - **Goal**: Conduct final testing and ensure the tool is production-ready.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Run end-to-end tests on the setup flow.
     2. Test error handling (e.g., invalid user inputs).
     3. Verify the global installation and update mechanism works seamlessly.

#### **5.2. Release the First Version**
   - **Goal**: Release the tool to the public.
   - **Tasks**:
     1. Tag and push the first release to GitHub.
     2. Announce the release on appropriate channels (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Go forums).
     3. Update the README and documentation for clarity.
